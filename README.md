# Tic Tac Toe with Min-Max Algorithm

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game project! This is a simple yet powerful implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, enhanced with the Min-Max algorithm to ensure an unbeatable AI opponent. The entire codebase, including all modifications and optimizations, was generated using ChatGPT through prompt engineering. Even this README file was crafted with the help of ChatGPT!

## Features

- **Classic Tic Tac Toe Gameplay**: Play the traditional 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game.
- **Two Game Modes**: 
  - **Human vs Human**: Play against a friend by entering player names.
  - **Human vs Computer**: Play against an unbeatable AI powered by the Min-Max algorithm.
- **Interactive Preview**: A live, interactable preview of the game is available below.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: The game is deployed on GitHub Pages for easy access and playability.

## Live Preview

## How to Play

### Game Modes

1. **Human vs Human**:
   - Enter the names of Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) when prompted.
   - Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their marks.
   - The game will announce the winner or declare a draw once the game is over.

2. **Human vs Computer**:
   - Enter your name as Player 1 (X). The AI will automatically play as Player 2 (O).
   - Click on any empty cell to place your mark (X).
   - The AI will automatically place its mark (O) after your move.
   - The game will announce the winner or declare a draw once the game is over.
## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and styling of the game.
- **JavaScript**: For the game logic and Min-Max algorithm implementation.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting and deploying the game.

## How It Was Built

This project was entirely generated using ChatGPT through a series of prompts and iterative refinements. The Min-Max algorithm, game logic, and even this README file were all created with the assistance of AI.
