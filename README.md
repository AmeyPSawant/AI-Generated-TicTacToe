# Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game project! This is a simple yet powerful implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, enhanced with the Minimax algorithm to ensure an unbeatable AI opponent. The entire codebase, including all modifications and optimizations, was generated using ChatGPT through prompt engineering. Even this README file was crafted with the help of ChatGPT!

## Features

- **Classic Tic Tac Toe Gameplay**: Play the traditional 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game.
- **Unbeatable AI**: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, ensuring a challenging experience.
- **Interactive Preview**: A live, interactable preview of the game is available below.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: The game is deployed on GitHub Pages for easy access and playability.

## Live Preview

2. **Choose Your Move**: Click on any empty cell to place your mark (X).
3. **AI Move**: The AI will automatically place its mark (O) after your move.
4. **Win or Draw**: The game will announce the winner or declare a draw once the game is over.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and styling of the game.
- **JavaScript**: For the game logic and Minimax algorithm implementation.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting and deploying the game.

## How It Was Built

This project was entirely generated using ChatGPT through a series of prompts and iterative refinements. The Minimax algorithm, game logic, and even this README file were all created with the assistance of AI.
